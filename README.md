# Python Programs: Even/Odd Number Checker and Summation Calculator

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, and loops.

## File Descriptions

### 1. file1.py — Even or Odd Number Checker

**Purpose**:  
This script prompts the user to enter an integer and determines whether the number is even or odd.

**Functionality**:
- Accepts input from the user.
- Converts the input to an integer.
- Uses the modulo operator to determine whether the number is divisible by 2.
- Displays a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.

**Example Usage**:
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd.

### 2. file2.py — Summation from 1 to 50

**Purpose**:  
This script calculates and displays the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

**Functionality**:
- Initializes a sum variable to zero.
- Iterates through numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.
- Adds each number to the sum.
- Displays the final sum after the loop completes.

**Example Output**:
The sum of all number from 1 to 50 is: 1275
